## Advantages
Training of the model is relatively easy

The model scales relatively well to high dimensional data

SVM is a useful alternative to neural networks

Trade-off amongst classifier complexity and error can be controlled explicitly

It is useful for both Linearly Separable and Non-linearly Separable data

Assured Optimality: The solution is guaranteed to be the global minimum due to the nature of Convex Optimization

## Disadvantages 
Picking right kernel and parameters can be computationally intensive

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), a structured representation of text yields better performance. However, SVMs cannot accommodate such structures(word embedding)
