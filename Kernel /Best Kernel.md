## RBF?
Radial basis function (RBF) is the best Kernel function.

RBF kernels are the most generalized form of kernelization and is one of the most widely used kernels due to its similarity to the Gaussian distribution or Normal Distributio.

The RBF kernel function for two points X₁ and X₂ computes the similarity or how close they are to each other.
 
It is commonly used in support vector machine classification.

It is - 

-easy to design 

-good generalization

-strong tolerance to input noise
