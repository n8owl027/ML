## SVM
SVM - Support Vector Machine.

Hyperplane - [If p=2] A straight  line which divides the data points into 2 parts/classes/categories.

Support Vectors − Datapoints or vectors which  are closest to the hyperplane.

Margin − It may be defined as the gap between two lines on the closet data points of different classes. It can be calculated as the perpendicular distance from the line to the support vectors. Large margin is considered as a good margin and small margin is considered as a bad margin.
