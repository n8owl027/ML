Hyperplane - [If p=2] A straight  line which divides the data points into 2 parts/classes/categories.

Support Vectors − Datapoints or vectors which  are closest to the hyperplane.

Margin − The distance between two lines on the closet data points of different classes. 

Good Margin - The maximum distance between two support vectors are considered as a good margin 

Bad Margin -  The maximum distance between two support vectors are considered as a bad margin.
