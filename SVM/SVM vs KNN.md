## Classification Speed
The SVM is extremely fast, classifying 12 megapixel aerial images in roughly 10 seconds.On the other hand,
kNN takes 40-50 seconds to classify the same image.

## Accuracy
The SVM provides significantly better classification accuracy than kNN.

## Interpret
SVM is easier to interpret than KNN.
 
 On the other hand, Interpreting KNN is more challenging.
