## SVM
SVM - Support Vector Machine.

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that works on both classification and regression problem statements. 

SVM  creates a line or a hyperplane which separates  data points into 2 parts/classes/categories.


Hyperplane -  A straight  line which divides the data points into 2 parts/classes/categories.

Support Vectors − Datapoints or vectors which  are closest to the hyperplane.

Margin − The distance between two lines on the closet data points of different classes. 

Good Margin - The maximum distance between two support vectors are considered as a good margin 

Bad Margin -  The maximum distance between two support vectors are considered as a bad margin.


Goal of SVM

The main goal of SVM is to divide the datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH).

First, SVM will create a hyperplane that divide the classes with maximum distance. Then, it will choose the hyperplane that separates the classes correctly.
