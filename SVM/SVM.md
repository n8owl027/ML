## SVM
SVM - Support Vector Machine.
SVM is also known as the support vector network.

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that works on both classification and regression problem statements. But mostly used in classification problem.

## SVM Classification
Handwriting recognition, Face detection, Email classification, Gene classification.

SVM  creates a line or a hyperplane which separates  data points into 2 parts/classes/categories.


## Hyperplane
A straight  line which divides the data points into 2 parts/classes/categories.

## Support Vectors 
Datapoints or vectors which  are closest to the hyperplane.

## Margin 
The distance between two lines on the closet data points of different classes. 

## Good Margin 
The maximum distance between two support vectors are considered as a good margin 

## Bad Margin 
The maximum distance between two support vectors are considered as a bad margin.


## Goal of SVM

The main goal of SVM is to divide the datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH).
SVM will create a hyperplane that divide the classes with maximum distance. Then, it will choose the hyperplane that separates the classes correctly.
